1. Making a device-local buffer
    - Why do you have to use new_slice? (I don't get that at all)
    - Very unclear that you have to specify size as the arg to new_slice but not in BufferCreateInfo
2. Lack of proper logging in example/tutorial code.
    - printing {error} instead of {error:?}
    - seems like timeout = None obfuscates errors, should put 5 secs in tutorials or something
3. Struct alignment
    - I didn't realize for a while that you could specify layout(scalar) in GLSL and it made repr(C) just work. Maybe
      make that much more obvious in shader docs.
    - Also link alignment discussion in shader docs from buffer docs
