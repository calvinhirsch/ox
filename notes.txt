TO-DO rust:
 - Macros for
    - Deriving DataComponentWrapper
    - Deriving DataComponentSet if all struct members are DataComponentWrapper or DataComponent (?)
    - Defining custom physical memory grid / virtual memory grid when members are all also grids
 - Consider making top level chunk bitmask data its own thing and separating it out from lods
 - Consider, instead of having a loaded bool for chunks, have an enum type for loaded/unloaded/placeholder -- although this
   may be complicated by the fact that each LOD has its own loaded state
 - Make all vecs slices (or better yet, arrays) where they can be

TO-DO shader:
 - Fix infinite loop while tracing ray. Happens at lvl 0 iteration 0 after 2-3 bounces
 - Experiment with loading material and doing ray bounce inside the inner loop

Plans:
 - Configurable terrain generation function at any LOD
 - Sub-voxels
