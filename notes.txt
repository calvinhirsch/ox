TO-DO rust:
 - Macros for
    - Deriving DataComponentWrapper
    - Deriving DataComponentSet if all struct members are DataComponentWrapper or DataComponent (?)
    - Defining custom physical memory grid / virtual memory grid when members are all also grids

TO-DO shader:
 - Fix infinite loop while tracing ray. Happens at lvl 0 iteration 0 after 2-3 bounces
 - Experiment with loading material and doing ray bounce inside the inner loop

Plans:
 - Configurable terrain generation function at any LOD
 - Sub-voxels
