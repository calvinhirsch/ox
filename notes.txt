TODO rust:
 - Fix: some rendering layers might have only a bitmask

TODO shader:
 - Fix infinite loop while tracing ray. Happens at lvl 0 iteration 0 after 2-3 bounces
 - Experiment with loading material and doing ray bounce inside the inner loop

Plans:
 - Configurable terrain generation function at any LOD
 - Sub-voxels
