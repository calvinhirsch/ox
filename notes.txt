For debugging: use qrenderdoc
For profiling GPU: use Nsight graphics (ngfx-ui), usually have to launch as root to use GPU trace profiler

TO-DO rust:
 - Look into whether chunk loading would break if you skip the buffer chunk loading zone at the edge of chunk
 - Macros for deriving stuff
    - datacomponent in renderer
 - Consider making top level chunk bitmask data its own thing and separating it out from lods
 - Consider, instead of having a loaded bool for chunks, have an enum type for loaded/unloaded/placeholder -- although this
   may be complicated by the fact that each LOD has its own loaded state
 - Consider making vecs slices

Plans:
 - Configurable terrain generation function at any LOD
 - Sub-voxels
 - look into doing chunk generation on the GPU (could generate data on GPU already in the right place then transfer to CPU)
